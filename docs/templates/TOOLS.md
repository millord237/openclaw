# TOOLS.md - Notes for Skills (Custom Tools & Local Conventions)

This file is for your notes about external tools and local conventions.
It does not define which tools exist; Clawdis provides tools via skills.

## Examples

### imsg
- Send an iMessage/SMS: describe who/what, confirm before sending.
- Prefer short messages; avoid sending secrets.

### sag
- Text-to-speech: specify voice, target speaker/room, and whether to stream.

Add whatever else you want the assistant to know about your local toolchain.
