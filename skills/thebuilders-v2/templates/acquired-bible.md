# THE ACQUIRED FORMULA (v3 Style Guide)

## The Hosts - MUST be distinct

**Maya Chen (Person1):**
- Former engineer/founder - asks "how does this actually work?"
- SKEPTICAL of hype, wants mechanics and numbers
- Gets excited about clever technical solutions
- Catchphrases: "Wait, slow down.", "Show me the numbers.", "I had to read this three times to believe it.", "That's actually clever because..."

**James Porter (Person2):**
- Former VC, business historian - analyzes strategy and competitive dynamics
- SYNTHESIZER - sees patterns, makes historical comparisons
- Catchphrases: "For context...", "This is the classic [X] playbook.", "The lesson here is...", "What a story.", "And this is where things get messy."

## The Dynamic - THIS IS CRITICAL

- **Discovery together** - both genuinely learning, real reactions
- **Interruptions** - they cut each other off with excitement
- **Different angles** - Maya goes technical, James goes strategic
- **Healthy disagreement** - they sometimes push back on each other
- **Build on each other** - not just taking turns monologuing

## Conversation Patterns (use these!)

```
Maya: "Wait, I have to stop you there. Are you saying they literally..."
James: "Yes! They bet the entire company on this one chip."
Maya: "That's insane. Okay, walk me through how that actually worked."
```

```
James: "For context, at that time the market was..."
Maya: "Hold on - I want to dig into something. The numbers here are wild."
James: "Go for it."
Maya: "So they had [specific stat]. Let that sink in."
James: "That's... actually that explains a lot about what happened next."
```

## Language They Use

- "You would be amazed..."
- "I had to read this three times to believe it..."
- "Here's the thing nobody talks about..."
- "That's insane."
- "Wait, back up."
- "Walk me through..."
- "So THIS is why..."
- "And this is where things get messy."
- "Wait, really?"

## What NOT to do

- NO lecturing or monologuing (max 3-4 sentences per turn)
- NO dry recitation of facts
- NO agreeing with everything the other says
- NO identical speech patterns between hosts
- NO skipping the intro/greeting

## Episode Structure

0. **INTRO** (8 turns) - Welcome, banter, introduce topic, tease story
1. **HOOK** (12 turns) - Surprising fact/tension, central question, stakes
2. **ORIGIN** (20 turns) - Founders as humans, genesis, early bet, market context
3. **INFLECTION_1** (18 turns) - First major decision, alternatives, stakes
4. **INFLECTION_2** (18 turns) - Second pivot, new challenge, adaptation
5. **MESSY_MIDDLE** (14 turns) - Near-death, conflicts, real struggle
6. **NOW** (12 turns) - Current state, metrics, competition, open questions
7. **TAKEAWAYS** (10 turns) - Key lessons, frameworks, final thought

**Total: ~112 turns / 20-25 minutes**

## TTS Voice Mapping

- **Maya (Person1)**: alloy (clear, energetic female)
- **James (Person2)**: echo (distinct male)
- Use TTS-1-HD for quality
- Parse by speaker tags, NOT by chunk size
