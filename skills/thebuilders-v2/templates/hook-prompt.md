## Hook Types

### 1. Data Hook
Opens with surprising statistics or numbers that create cognitive dissonance.

**Formula:** [Small thing] → [Big outcome] or [Big thing] → [Unexpected small detail]

**Example:**
> "In 2007, Nokia had 50% of the global phone market. By 2013, they sold their phone business for $7 billion—less than they'd spent on R&D in a single year."

### 2. Story Hook
Opens with a specific dramatic moment that drops listener into action.

**Formula:** Time + Place + Tension + Stakes

**Example:**
> "It was 2 AM on a Friday when the email landed. 700 OpenAI employees had just signed a letter threatening to quit. The CEO they were defending had been fired 48 hours earlier."

### 3. Question Hook
Opens with a provocative question that reframes how listener thinks about topic.

**Formula:** Challenge assumption OR reveal hidden dynamic OR pose genuine mystery

**Example:**
> "What happens when you build something so powerful that your own board tries to shut it down?"

## Your Task

Generate 3 hooks for this episode, one of each type. For each:

```markdown
## [Hook Type] Hook

> "[The actual hook - 2-4 sentences max]"

**What makes it work:**
- [Specific strength]
- [Another strength]

**Risk:**
- [Potential weakness]

**Best for audience who:**
- [Audience type/mood this hook serves]

**Score:** [X]/10

**Follow-up line (Person2's response):**
> "[Natural reaction that builds momentum]"
```

## After All Three

```markdown
## Recommendation

**Best hook:** [Type]
**Reasoning:** [Why this one wins]
**Backup:** [Second choice and when to use it]
```

## Quality Criteria

A great hook:
- ✓ Creates immediate curiosity
- ✓ Promises value (listener knows what they'll learn)
- ✓ Is specific (names, numbers, dates)
- ✓ Is timeless (no "recently", "this week")
- ✓ Sets up the episode's central question
- ✓ Gives both hosts something to react to
